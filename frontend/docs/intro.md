# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This course will prepare you for the future of intelligent machines that can interact with and navigate the physical world.

<DocPageActions chapter="intro" />

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics, enabling machines to perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital environments, Physical AI systems:

- **Perceive** the real world through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, touch sensors)
- **Reason** about physical properties (objects, forces, spatial relationships)
- **Act** in the physical world through actuators (motors, grippers, limbs)
- **Learn** from physical interactions to improve performance

### Key Components of Physical AI

1. **Perception Systems**: Computer vision, depth sensing, tactile feedback
2. **Reasoning & Planning**: Spatial understanding, physics simulation, decision-making
3. **Actuation & Control**: Motion planning, force control, manipulation
4. **Learning Systems**: Reinforcement learning, imitation learning, sim-to-real transfer
